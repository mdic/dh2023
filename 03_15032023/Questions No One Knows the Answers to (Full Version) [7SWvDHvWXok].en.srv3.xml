  <p time="15448" is_ac="false">On a typical day at school,</p>
  <p time="18147" is_ac="false">endless hours are spent learning
the answers to questions,</p>
  <p time="22755" is_ac="false">but right now, we'll do the opposite.</p>
  <p time="26384" is_ac="false">We're going to focus on questions
where you can't learn the answers</p>
  <p time="29551" is_ac="false">because they're unknown.</p>
  <p time="31320" is_ac="false">I used to puzzle about a lot of things
as a boy, for example:</p>
  <p time="36662" is_ac="false">What would it feel like to be a dog?</p>
  <p time="39101" is_ac="false">Do fish feel pain?</p>
  <p time="41412" is_ac="false">How about insects?</p>
  <p time="43784" is_ac="false">Was the Big Bang just an accident?</p>
  <p time="47607" is_ac="false">And is there a God?</p>
  <p time="49000" is_ac="false">And if so, how are we so sure
that it's a He and not a She?</p>
  <p time="53557" is_ac="false">Why do so many innocent people
and animals suffer terrible things?</p>
  <p time="57544" is_ac="false">Is there really a plan for my life?</p>
  <p time="60596" is_ac="false">Is the future yet to be written,</p>
  <p time="62371" is_ac="false">or is it already written
and we just can't see it?</p>
  <p time="65788" is_ac="false">But then, do I have free will?
I mean, who am I anyway?</p>
  <p time="68756" is_ac="false">Am I just a biological machine?</p>
  <p time="71371" is_ac="false">But then, why am I conscious?
What is consciousness?</p>
  <p time="75768" is_ac="false">Will robots become conscious one day?</p>
  <p time="79291" is_ac="false">I mean, I kind of assumed that some day</p>
  <p time="81721" is_ac="false">I would be told the answers
to all these questions.</p>
  <p time="85557" is_ac="false">Someone must know, right?</p>
  <p time="88517" is_ac="false">Guess what? No one knows.</p>
  <p time="92167" is_ac="false">Most of those questions
puzzle me more now than ever.</p>
  <p time="95784" is_ac="false">But diving into them is exciting</p>
  <p time="98311" is_ac="false">because it takes you
to the edge of knowledge,</p>
  <p time="100618" is_ac="false">and you never know what you'll find there.</p>
  <p time="103921" is_ac="false">So, two questions that no one
on Earth knows the answer to.</p>
  <p time="110704" is_ac="false">(Music)</p>
  <p time="112413" is_ac="false">[How many universes are there?]</p>
  <p time="117812" is_ac="false">Sometimes when I'm on a long plane flight,</p>
  <p time="120000" is_ac="false">I gaze out at all those
mountains and deserts</p>
  <p time="122892" is_ac="false">and try to get my head
around how vast our Earth is.</p>
  <p time="126608" is_ac="false">And then I remember
that there's an object we see every day</p>
  <p time="129394" is_ac="false">that would literally fit
one million Earths inside it:</p>
  <p time="133016" is_ac="false">the Sun.</p>
  <p time="134056" is_ac="false">It seems impossibly big.</p>
  <p time="135690" is_ac="false">But in the great scheme
of things, it's a pinprick,</p>
  <p time="139174" is_ac="false">one of about 400 billion stars
in the Milky Way galaxy,</p>
  <p time="143142" is_ac="false">which you can see on a clear night</p>
  <p time="145218" is_ac="false">as a pale white mist
stretched across the sky.</p>
  <p time="148511" is_ac="false">And it gets worse.</p>
  <p time="149634" is_ac="false">There are maybe 100 billion galaxies
detectable by our telescopes.</p>
  <p time="153758" is_ac="false">So if each star was the size
of a single grain of sand,</p>
  <p time="158061" is_ac="false">just the Milky Way has enough stars</p>
  <p time="160085" is_ac="false">to fill a 30-foot by 30-foot
stretch of beach</p>
  <p time="162767" is_ac="false">three feet deep with sand.</p>
  <p time="165903" is_ac="false">And the entire Earth
doesn't have enough beaches</p>
  <p time="168629" is_ac="false">to represent the stars
in the overall universe.</p>
  <p time="171263" is_ac="false">Such a beach would continue for literally
hundreds of millions of miles.</p>
  <p time="175791" is_ac="false">Holy Stephen Hawking,
that is a lot of stars.</p>
  <p time="179968" is_ac="false">But he and other physicists
now believe in a reality</p>
  <p time="182916" is_ac="false">that is unimaginably bigger still.</p>
  <p time="186002" is_ac="false">I mean, first of all,
the 100 billion galaxies</p>
  <p time="188208" is_ac="false">within range of our telescopes</p>
  <p time="189740" is_ac="false">are probably a minuscule
fraction of the total.</p>
  <p time="192353" is_ac="false">Space itself is expanding
at an accelerating pace.</p>
  <p time="196379" is_ac="false">The vast majority of the galaxies</p>
  <p time="198782" is_ac="false">are separating from us so fast
that light from them may never reach us.</p>
  <p time="203257" is_ac="false">Still, our physical reality here on Earth</p>
  <p time="206005" is_ac="false">is intimately connected
to those distant, invisible galaxies.</p>
  <p time="209961" is_ac="false">We can think of them
as part of our universe.</p>
  <p time="212744" is_ac="false">They make up a single, giant edifice</p>
  <p time="215000" is_ac="false">obeying the same physical laws
and all made from the same types of atoms,</p>
  <p time="218484" is_ac="false">electrons, protons, quarks, neutrinos,
that make up you and me.</p>
  <p time="222690" is_ac="false">However, recent theories in physics,
including one called string theory,</p>
  <p time="226993" is_ac="false">are now telling us there could be
countless other universes</p>
  <p time="230000" is_ac="false">built on different types of particles,</p>
  <p time="232000" is_ac="false">with different properties,
obeying different laws.</p>
  <p time="234928" is_ac="false">Most of these universes
could never support life,</p>
  <p time="237460" is_ac="false">and might flash in and out
of existence in a nanosecond.</p>
  <p time="241085" is_ac="false">But nonetheless, combined,
they make up a vast multiverse</p>
  <p time="244584" is_ac="false">of possible universes
in up to 11 dimensions,</p>
  <p time="247646" is_ac="false">featuring wonders
beyond our wildest imagination.</p>
  <p time="252206" is_ac="false">The leading version of string theory
predicts a multiverse</p>
  <p time="255103" is_ac="false">made up of 10 to the 500 universes.</p>
  <p time="257000" is_ac="false">That's a one followed by 500 zeros,</p>
  <p time="260892" is_ac="false">a number so vast that if every atom</p>
  <p time="263318" is_ac="false">in our observable universe
had its own universe,</p>
  <p time="267448" is_ac="false">and all of the atoms
in all those universes each had</p>
  <p time="269901" is_ac="false">their own universe,</p>
  <p time="272000" is_ac="false">and you repeated that for two more cycles,</p>
  <p time="274346" is_ac="false">you'd still be at a tiny
fraction of the total,</p>
  <p time="277771" is_ac="false">namely, one trillion trillion trillion
trillion trillion trillion trillion</p>
  <p time="281272" is_ac="false">trillion trillion trillion trillion
trillion trillion trillion trillionth.</p>
  <p time="286421" is_ac="false">(Laughter)</p>
  <p time="287758" is_ac="false">But even that number
is minuscule compared to another number:</p>
  <p time="293012" is_ac="false">infinity.</p>
  <p time="294488" is_ac="false">Some physicists think the space-time
continuum is literally infinite</p>
  <p time="297703" is_ac="false">and that it contains an infinite number
of so-called pocket universes</p>
  <p time="301104" is_ac="false">with varying properties.</p>
  <p time="303107" is_ac="false">How's your brain doing?</p>
  <p time="305061" is_ac="false">Quantum theory adds a whole new wrinkle.</p>
  <p time="307000" is_ac="false">I mean, the theory's been proven
true beyond all doubt,</p>
  <p time="309676" is_ac="false">but interpreting it is baffling,</p>
  <p time="311909" is_ac="false">and some physicists think
you can only un-baffle it</p>
  <p time="315030" is_ac="false">if you imagine that huge numbers
of parallel universes</p>
  <p time="317656" is_ac="false">are being spawned every moment,</p>
  <p time="320261" is_ac="false">and many of these universes would actually
be very like the world we're in,</p>
  <p time="323809" is_ac="false">would include multiple copies of you.</p>
  <p time="325985" is_ac="false">In one such universe,
you'd graduate with honors</p>
  <p time="328515" is_ac="false">and marry the person of your dreams,
and in another, not so much.</p>
  <p time="333293" is_ac="false">Well, there are still some scientists
who would say, hogwash.</p>
  <p time="336301" is_ac="false">The only meaningful answer to the question
of how many universes there are is one.</p>
  <p time="340822" is_ac="false">Only one universe.</p>
  <p time="342678" is_ac="false">And a few philosophers
and mystics might argue</p>
  <p time="345900" is_ac="false">that even our own universe is an illusion.</p>
  <p time="349672" is_ac="false">So, as you can see, right now</p>
  <p time="351077" is_ac="false">there is no agreement
on this question, not even close.</p>
  <p time="354772" is_ac="false">All we know is the answer is somewhere
between zero and infinity.</p>
  <p time="359173" is_ac="false">Well, I guess we know one other thing.</p>
  <p time="361782" is_ac="false">This is a pretty cool time
to be studying physics.</p>
  <p time="365000" is_ac="false">We just might be undergoing
the biggest paradigm shift in knowledge</p>
  <p time="368677" is_ac="false">that humanity has ever seen.</p>
  <p time="370512" is_ac="false">(Music)</p>
  <p time="374609" is_ac="false">[Why can't we see evidence of alien life?]</p>
  <p time="377704" is_ac="false">Somewhere out there in that vast universe</p>
  <p time="380877" is_ac="false">there must surely be countless
other planets teeming with life.</p>
  <p time="383961" is_ac="false">But why don't we see any evidence of it?</p>
  <p time="387265" is_ac="false">Well, this is the famous question
asked by Enrico Fermi in 1950:</p>
  <p time="390289" is_ac="false">Where is everybody?</p>
  <p time="393006" is_ac="false">Conspiracy theorists claim that UFOs
are visiting all the time</p>
  <p time="396844" is_ac="false">and the reports are just being covered up,</p>
  <p time="399014" is_ac="false">but honestly, they aren't very convincing.</p>
  <p time="401882" is_ac="false">But that leaves a real riddle.</p>
  <p time="404330" is_ac="false">In the past year,
the Kepler space observatory</p>
  <p time="407044" is_ac="false">has found hundreds of planets
just around nearby stars.</p>
  <p time="410580" is_ac="false">And if you extrapolate that data,</p>
  <p time="412335" is_ac="false">it looks like there could
be half a trillion planets</p>
  <p time="415721" is_ac="false">just in our own galaxy.</p>
  <p time="418267" is_ac="false">If any one in 10,000 has conditions</p>
  <p time="420378" is_ac="false">that might support a form of life,</p>
  <p time="423000" is_ac="false">that's still 50 million possible
life-harboring planets</p>
  <p time="426000" is_ac="false">right here in the Milky Way.</p>
  <p time="428551" is_ac="false">So here's the riddle:</p>
  <p time="430263" is_ac="false">our Earth didn't form</p>
  <p time="431923" is_ac="false">until about nine billion years
after the Big Bang.</p>
  <p time="435685" is_ac="false">Countless other planets in our galaxy
should have formed earlier,</p>
  <p time="439117" is_ac="false">and given life a chance to get underway</p>
  <p time="441459" is_ac="false">billions, or certainly many millions
of years earlier than happened on Earth.</p>
  <p time="447268" is_ac="false">If just a few of them
had spawned intelligent life</p>
  <p time="450001" is_ac="false">and started creating technologies,</p>
  <p time="452569" is_ac="false">those technologies would have
had millions of years</p>
  <p time="455833" is_ac="false">to grow in complexity and power.</p>
  <p time="459166" is_ac="false">On Earth,</p>
  <p time="460769" is_ac="false">we've seen how dramatically
technology can accelerate</p>
  <p time="463664" is_ac="false">in just 100 years.</p>
  <p time="466407" is_ac="false">In millions of years,
an intelligent alien civilization</p>
  <p time="470000" is_ac="false">could easily have spread out
across the galaxy,</p>
  <p time="472731" is_ac="false">perhaps creating giant
energy-harvesting artifacts</p>
  <p time="476138" is_ac="false">or fleets of colonizing spaceships</p>
  <p time="479104" is_ac="false">or glorious works of art
that fill the night sky.</p>
  <p time="483000" is_ac="false">At the very least, you'd think
they'd be revealing their presence,</p>
  <p time="486153" is_ac="false">deliberately or otherwise,</p>
  <p time="487507" is_ac="false">through electromagnetic signals
of one kind or another.</p>
  <p time="491271" is_ac="false">And yet we see no convincing
evidence of any of it.</p>
  <p time="493804" is_ac="false">Why?</p>
  <p time="496000" is_ac="false">Well, there are numerous possible answers,
some of them quite dark.</p>
  <p time="501331" is_ac="false">Maybe a single,
superintelligent civilization</p>
  <p time="504000" is_ac="false">has indeed taken over the galaxy</p>
  <p time="507125" is_ac="false">and has imposed strict radio silence</p>
  <p time="509671" is_ac="false">because it's paranoid
of any potential competitors.</p>
  <p time="512926" is_ac="false">It's just sitting there
ready to obliterate</p>
  <p time="515851" is_ac="false">anything that becomes a threat.</p>
  <p time="519010" is_ac="false">Or maybe they're not that intelligent,</p>
  <p time="522299" is_ac="false">or perhaps the evolution
of an intelligence</p>
  <p time="524975" is_ac="false">capable of creating
sophisticated technology</p>
  <p time="527047" is_ac="false">is far rarer than we've assumed.</p>
  <p time="529041" is_ac="false">After all, it's only happened once
on Earth in four billion years.</p>
  <p time="533848" is_ac="false">Maybe even that was incredibly lucky.</p>
  <p time="536452" is_ac="false">Maybe we are the first
such civilization in our galaxy.</p>
  <p time="541042" is_ac="false">Or, perhaps civilization carries with it
the seeds of its own destruction</p>
  <p time="546524" is_ac="false">through the inability to control
the technologies it creates.</p>
  <p time="551478" is_ac="false">But there are numerous
more hopeful answers.</p>
  <p time="553624" is_ac="false">For a start, we're not looking that hard,</p>
  <p time="555645" is_ac="false">and we're spending
a pitiful amount of money on it.</p>
  <p time="558547" is_ac="false">Only a tiny fraction
of the stars in our galaxy</p>
  <p time="561871" is_ac="false">have really been looked at closely
for signs of interesting signals.</p>
  <p time="566144" is_ac="false">And perhaps we're not looking
the right way.</p>
  <p time="569000" is_ac="false">Maybe as civilizations develop,</p>
  <p time="571000" is_ac="false">they quickly discover
communication technologies</p>
  <p time="573310" is_ac="false">far more sophisticated and useful
than electromagnetic waves.</p>
  <p time="578183" is_ac="false">Maybe all the action takes place
inside the mysterious</p>
  <p time="581507" is_ac="false">recently discovered dark matter,</p>
  <p time="583548" is_ac="false">or dark energy, that appear to account
for most of the universe's mass.</p>
  <p time="589348" is_ac="false">Or, maybe we're looking
at the wrong scale.</p>
  <p time="592000" is_ac="false">Perhaps intelligent
civilizations come to realize</p>
  <p time="595000" is_ac="false">that life is ultimately
just complex patterns of information</p>
  <p time="597834" is_ac="false">interacting with each other
in a beautiful way,</p>
  <p time="600062" is_ac="false">and that that can happen more
efficiently at a small scale.</p>
  <p time="603379" is_ac="false">So, just as on Earth,
clunky stereo systems have shrunk</p>
  <p time="606000" is_ac="false">to beautiful, tiny iPods,
maybe intelligent life itself,</p>
  <p time="609000" is_ac="false">in order to reduce its footprint
on the environment,</p>
  <p time="611748" is_ac="false">has turned itself microscopic.</p>
  <p time="613715" is_ac="false">So the Solar System
might be teeming with aliens,</p>
  <p time="616048" is_ac="false">and we're just not noticing them.</p>
  <p time="617677" is_ac="false">Maybe the very ideas in our heads
are a form of alien life.</p>
  <p time="621580" is_ac="false">Well, okay, that's a crazy thought.</p>
  <p time="624274" is_ac="false">The aliens made me say it.</p>
  <p time="626445" is_ac="false">But it is cool that ideas do seem
to have a life all of their own</p>
  <p time="630247" is_ac="false">and that they outlive their creators.</p>
  <p time="633724" is_ac="false">Maybe biological life
is just a passing phase.</p>
  <p time="639459" is_ac="false">Well, within the next 15 years,</p>
  <p time="641000" is_ac="false">we could start seeing
real spectroscopic information</p>
  <p time="644000" is_ac="false">from promising nearby planets</p>
  <p time="645834" is_ac="false">that will reveal just
how life-friendly they might be.</p>
  <p time="648394" is_ac="false">And meanwhile, SETI, the Search
for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,</p>
  <p time="652000" is_ac="false">is now releasing its data to the public</p>
  <p time="654000" is_ac="false">so that millions of citizen scientists,
maybe including you,</p>
  <p time="657000" is_ac="false">can bring the power of the crowd
to join the search.</p>
  <p time="660582" is_ac="false">And here on Earth, amazing experiments</p>
  <p time="662620" is_ac="false">are being done to try
to create life from scratch,</p>
  <p time="665000" is_ac="false">life that might be very different
from the DNA forms we know.</p>
  <p time="669320" is_ac="false">All of this will help us understand
whether the universe is teeming with life</p>
  <p time="674000" is_ac="false">or whether, indeed, it's just us.</p>
  <p time="679823" is_ac="false">Either answer, in its own way,</p>
  <p time="682332" is_ac="false">is awe-inspiring,</p>
  <p time="685407" is_ac="false">because even if we are alone,</p>
  <p time="687000" is_ac="false">the fact that we think and dream
and ask these questions</p>
  <p time="691555" is_ac="false">might yet turn out to be</p>
  <p time="693171" is_ac="false">one of the most important facts
about the universe.</p>
  <p time="696347" is_ac="false">And I have one more piece
of good news for you.</p>
  <p time="699105" is_ac="false">The quest for knowledge
and understanding never gets dull.</p>
  <p time="701955" is_ac="false">It doesn't. It's actually the opposite.</p>
  <p time="704000" is_ac="false">The more you know,
the more amazing the world seems.</p>
  <p time="707758" is_ac="false">And it's the crazy possibilities,
the unanswered questions,</p>
  <p time="711215" is_ac="false">that pull us forward.</p>
  <p time="712476" is_ac="false">So stay curious.</p>
