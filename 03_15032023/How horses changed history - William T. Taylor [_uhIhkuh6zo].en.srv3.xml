  <p time="6753" is_ac="false">People have been captivated by horses 
for a long time.</p>
  <p time="10840" is_ac="false">They appear more than any other animal 
in cave paintings</p>
  <p time="14510" is_ac="false">dating back 30,000 years.</p>
  <p time="17263" is_ac="false">But how did horses make the journey
from wild animals</p>
  <p time="21184" is_ac="false">to ones humans could hitch
themselves to and even ride,</p>
  <p time="25188" is_ac="false">determining the fate of civilizations
and dramatically altering history?</p>
  <p time="30860" is_ac="false">Equids originally evolved
in North America.</p>
  <p time="34530" is_ac="false">Sometime after 4 million years ago,</p>
  <p time="37658" is_ac="false">ancient equid species began trotting 
across the Bering land bridge.</p>
  <p time="42497" is_ac="false">Eventually, they spread 
through Eurasia and into Africa,</p>
  <p time="46501" is_ac="false">diversifying into the lineages
that would lead to modern-day horses,</p>
  <p time="50880" is_ac="false">donkeys, and zebras.</p>
  <p time="53341" is_ac="false">Early humans, including generations of the
first people to live in the Americas,</p>
  <p time="58262" is_ac="false">hunted wild horses, sometimes 
fashioning their bones into tools.</p>
  <p time="63392" is_ac="false">Then, between 15,000 and 5,000 years ago,</p>
  <p time="67313" is_ac="false">likely because of a changing climate,
hunting by humans,</p>
  <p time="70942" is_ac="false">and competition with bison,</p>
  <p time="73194" is_ac="false">horses disappeared from the American
archaeological record.</p>
  <p time="77115" is_ac="false">But they’d be back eventually.</p>
  <p time="79617" is_ac="false">In the meantime, on the other side 
of the world around 2,000 BCE,</p>
  <p time="84413" is_ac="false">something very consequential happened:</p>
  <p time="87041" is_ac="false">people on the western Eurasian steppe
domesticated horses.</p>
  <p time="91462" is_ac="false">By then, people in western Asia had
already domesticated many animals</p>
  <p time="95925" is_ac="false">and begun using some of them
to pull carts.</p>
  <p time="99053" is_ac="false">But, because horses were generally faster
and more difficult to control,</p>
  <p time="103766" is_ac="false">steppe people developed 
a bridle-and-bit system</p>
  <p time="107395" is_ac="false">and chariots with lighter, spoked wheels.</p>
  <p time="111190" is_ac="false">Horses were soon integrated 
into many ancient cultures.</p>
  <p time="115027" is_ac="false">In contrast with 
horse-drawn charioteering,</p>
  <p time="117905" is_ac="false">horseback riding appears to have been
less common at first.</p>
  <p time="123161" is_ac="false">Archaeological evidence suggests 
that people who did mount horses</p>
  <p time="126956" is_ac="false">during this early stage</p>
  <p time="128749" is_ac="false">did so without structured saddles 
or stirrups.</p>
  <p time="132420" is_ac="false">This sometimes altered or damaged 
the skeletons of riders and horses alike.</p>
  <p time="138801" is_ac="false">People continued breeding 
for less aggressive horses</p>
  <p time="142096" is_ac="false">with greater endurance 
and weight-bearing abilities.</p>
  <p time="145349" is_ac="false">And they developed techniques and tools
for improved control and comfort.</p>
  <p time="150646" is_ac="false">After around 1000 BCE,</p>
  <p time="153316" is_ac="false">cavalry appeared in combat 
across much of Asia.</p>
  <p time="157862" is_ac="false">Riders of steppe and desert cultures 
became renowned</p>
  <p time="161365" is_ac="false">for their prowess on horseback.</p>
  <p time="164160" is_ac="false">Ceremonial horse sacrifice also made 
its way into the funerary traditions</p>
  <p time="168831" is_ac="false">of some cultures.</p>
  <p time="170249" is_ac="false">One royal Scythian burial site 
from around the 9th century BCE</p>
  <p time="175087" is_ac="false">contained the remains of approximately 
200 horses fitted with riding gear.</p>
  <p time="181093" is_ac="false">Officials in ancient China recognized 
how advantageous horses were</p>
  <p time="185223" is_ac="false">for their neighbors</p>
  <p time="186307" is_ac="false">and some coveted larger numbers of them
for their own empire.</p>
  <p time="190061" is_ac="false">Around 100 BCE, the Chinese emperor 
reportedly ordered a 30,000-man army west</p>
  <p time="196692" is_ac="false">that laid siege to a city 
and had its king killed—</p>
  <p time="200571" is_ac="false">all for 3,000 of the so-called 
“heavenly horses” of Ferghana.</p>
  <p time="206327" is_ac="false">Between the 4th and 8th centuries CE,</p>
  <p time="209205" is_ac="false">steppe horsemen spread riding technologies
like stirrups across cultures.</p>
  <p time="214502" is_ac="false">And nomadic groups eventually coalesced 
into unstoppable forces on horseback.</p>
  <p time="220967" is_ac="false">The Mongol Empire rose to power 
in the 13th century,</p>
  <p time="225012" is_ac="false">and raided, traded, and toppled empires 
over previously unthinkable distances.</p>
  <p time="231227" is_ac="false">They developed a horse-backed 
postal relay system</p>
  <p time="234814" is_ac="false">that stretched more than 
60,000 kilometers.</p>
  <p time="237984" is_ac="false">Their imperial successes relied 
on the well-being of their horses—</p>
  <p time="242154" is_ac="false">and leaders knew it.</p>
  <p time="243906" is_ac="false">In 1252, before launching 
his next military campaigns,</p>
  <p time="248536" is_ac="false">Möngke Khan sent officials
ahead to prohibit cattle grazing</p>
  <p time="253666" is_ac="false">so there’d be plentiful pastureland 
for their steeds.</p>
  <p time="257753" is_ac="false">Horses continued to spread,</p>
  <p time="259714" is_ac="false">eventually spurring equestrian empires
reaching a south of the Sahara.</p>
  <p time="264593" is_ac="false">By the mid-14th century, the Mali Empire 
was said to have had</p>
  <p time="268556" is_ac="false">a cavalry of more than 10,000</p>
  <p time="271392" is_ac="false">that controlled some 1 million 
square kilometers of West Africa.</p>
  <p time="276439" is_ac="false">And by 1500, horses were finally 
reintroduced to the Americas.</p>
  <p time="282111" is_ac="false">They appear to have escaped 
Spanish control rapidly</p>
  <p time="285531" is_ac="false">as Indigenous people from the Pampas
to the Great Plains</p>
  <p time="288784" is_ac="false">exchanged them via 
expansive trade networks.</p>
  <p time="293497" is_ac="false">Colonization and trade spread horses
even further around the globe.</p>
  <p time="298419" is_ac="false">And well into the 20th century they were 
a widespread and essential means</p>
  <p time="302965" is_ac="false">of travel and transport.</p>
  <p time="304967" is_ac="false">This didn’t come without problems:</p>
  <p time="306844" is_ac="false">issues of hygiene 
and animal welfare emerged,</p>
  <p time="309972" is_ac="false">especially in cities.</p>
  <p time="311640" is_ac="false">And many human hubs transformed 
with the introduction</p>
  <p time="315102" is_ac="false">of non-living modes of transport,
like the automobile.</p>
  <p time="319315" is_ac="false">Nevertheless, people have maintained their
multifaceted relationships with horses—</p>
  <p time="324278" is_ac="false">riding, herding, racing, or admiring them—</p>
  <p time="327239" is_ac="false">from the steppes of Mongolia 
to the prairies of Montana,</p>
  <p time="330576" is_ac="false">ever since.</p>
