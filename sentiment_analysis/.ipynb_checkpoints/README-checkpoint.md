# Analysing the sentiment of Youtube comments using AI

1. First, let's install the required tools using the command below. This is the first of two downloads whose size may exceed 250MB, so be patient and only install them if you have an unmetered internet connection!

> `pip install transformers torch torchvision torchaudio`

2. Now open the [`yt-comments_sentimentAnalysis-AI.ipynb`](https://github.com/mdic/dh2023/blob/main/sentiment_analysis/yt-comments_sentimentAnalysis-AI.ipynb) script, and download it in the same folder where you downloaded the Youtube comments. As usual, open the link, then click on `Raw`; save the page that opens inside your project's folder, by naming it `yt-comments_sentimentAnalysis-AI.ipynb`.
3. Open the newly downloaded script in Jupyter after using the command below in your terminal to start Jupyter Lab:

> `jupyter lab`

4. If the script does not show the usual code blocks, right-click on the file and delete the `.txt` extension at the end of the filename if present once the file is saved).

Then open the script in Jupyter and run the two blocks.
