Oddly the music would remain normal unless an actual Starman was collected within a level (which would also wear out the invincibility sooner.)

But the more I think about it, the code also granted a decent amount of time to complete levels, so waiting for the timer to go down at a flagpole would negate its use for speedrun purposes (unless perhaps someone modifies the code just enough or added another code to alter the timer.)"	0.0	0.963	0.037	0.5023

Goal

Beat the game as fast as possible by any means necessary.

Times below 5:00.00 are treated with suspicion. It is highly recommended that you stream all of your attempts and provide split files to have your run accepted.

Times below 5:00.00 require an input file if you are playing on an emulator that can record input files.

Using savestates to the title screen is prohibited. You must use the reset function on your emulator or console and the reset must be shown in the video. 

It doesn‚Äôt say anything about you can‚Äôt mod the game, so yes this is legal. And I think the name should be Kosmic and chat.
